# DataScienceFromScratch
Saving my working here for the Data Science book I am reading through.

All the code from the book is freely available from the authors repo.
I haven't used any of this I prefer to type out the code from the book myself.
Yes I will make errors but that is how I learn.

Note also I prefer to run all the asserts from a separate module, so I give myself a little extra work with that
but it agin helps me to understand the code better as I have to resolve all the imports across the modules.
Keeping me reading the code more and digesting what has been written by the author.

Note: I am completely green to Data Science as explained in the book but my experience in python is good enough
to work in this modular manner.
